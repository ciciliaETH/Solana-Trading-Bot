# Solana Trading Bot

This project is a Telegram bot designed for trading on the Solana network. The bot is focused on providing secure and efficient trading features, particularly for new coins. The core functionalities include automatic buying of new coins based on specific criteria and advanced anti-bot measures.

## Project Description

I am developing a Telegram bot for trading on the Solana network with the following main features:

- **Auto Buy New Coins**: The bot automatically buys new tokens based on selected criteria, such as liquidity being burned and revoked mint authority. The bot ensures that tokens are safe and not suspicious to avoid potential rug pulls.
- **Anti-MEV Bot**: Implements measures to protect against Miner Extractable Value (MEV) attacks.
- **High Transaction Speed**: Designed for extremely fast transaction processing to stay competitive in the trading environment.
- **Security Features**: Ensures that tokens meet safety criteria to avoid scams or suspicious activities.
- **Development Timeline**: The bot token and its features will be completed within 30 days from the creation of this repository.

## Features

- **Create New Wallet**: Generate a new Solana wallet with a public and private key.
- **Import Wallet**: Connect an existing Solana wallet using your private key.
- **Manage Multiple Wallets**: Store and manage multiple wallets within the bot.
- **Secure Wallet Deletion**: Delete a wallet only after confirming that the private key has been copied.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and interactive Telegram bot interface for easy navigation.
